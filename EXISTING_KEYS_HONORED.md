# How This Package Honors Your Existing Setup

## ‚úÖ YES - It Uses Your Existing API Keys!

The updated package **FULLY HONORS** your existing setup:

### 1. **Existing Mac Keychain Entries** (Your 40+ API Keys)
- ‚úÖ Checks for existing keys FIRST
- ‚úÖ Uses them without re-importing
- ‚úÖ Shows count of existing secured keys
- ‚úÖ Never overwrites existing keys

### 2. **If You Have a .env File**
- Only imports keys that DON'T already exist
- Skips any keys already in Keychain
- Shows which keys are new vs existing

### 3. **How It Works**

When you run `SETUP_COMPLETE.command`:

1. **First** - Checks if you have keys in Keychain (you do!)
2. **Finds them** - Reports "Found existing API keys in Mac Keychain"
3. **Uses them** - Docker container gets access to your secured keys
4. **No duplication** - Doesn't re-import what's already there

### 4. **Your Current Keys Are Safe**

- Your 40+ API keys from the original setup are preserved
- OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc. all stay intact
- The MCP server reads directly from your existing Keychain

### 5. **Testing Your Existing Keys**

After setup, ask Claude:
- "Test the bridge" - Will show count of your actual keys
- "Call OpenAI" - Will use your existing OPENAI_API_KEY
- "List APIs" - Shows all services you have keys for

## üîê Bottom Line

**Your existing API keys are 100% safe and will be used!**
The package is smart enough to:
- Use what's already there
- Only add what's missing
- Never duplicate or overwrite

You won't lose any of your secured API keys!
